July 20th, 2022
===============
**New this release:**
- üéâ (all, [aws-sdk-rust#567](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/issues/567)) Updated the smithy client's retry behavior to allow for a configurable initial backoff. Previously, the initial backoff
    (named `r` in the code) was set to 2 seconds. This is not an ideal default for services that expect clients to quickly
    retry failed request attempts. Now, users can set quicker (or slower) backoffs according to their needs.
- (all, [smithy-rs#1263](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy-rs/issues/1263)) Add checksum calculation and validation wrappers for HTTP bodies.
- (all, [smithy-rs#1263](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy-rs/issues/1263)) `aws_smithy_http::header::append_merge_header_maps`, a function for merging two `HeaderMap`s, is now public.


v0.45.0 (June 28th, 2022)
=========================
**Breaking Changes:**
- ‚ö† ([smithy-rs#932](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy-rs/issues/932)) Replaced use of `pin-project` with equivalent `pin-project-lite`. For pinned enum tuple variants and tuple structs, this
    change requires that we switch to using enum struct variants and regular structs. Most of the structs and enums that
    were updated had only private fields/variants and so have the same public API. However, this change does affect the
    public API of `aws_smithy_http_tower::map_request::MapRequestFuture<F, E>`. The `Inner` and `Ready` variants contained a
    single value. Each have been converted to struct variants and the inner value is now accessible by the `inner` field
    instead of the `0` field.

**New this release:**
- üéâ ([smithy-rs#1411](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy-rs/issues/1411), [smithy-rs#1167](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy-rs/issues/1167)) Upgrade to Gradle 7. This change is not a breaking change, however, users of smithy-rs will need to switch to JDK 17
- üêõ ([smithy-rs#1505](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy-rs/issues/1505), @kiiadi) Fix issue with codegen on Windows where module names were incorrectly determined from filenames

v0.44.0 (June 22nd, 2022)
=========================
**New this release:**
- ([smithy-rs#1460](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy-rs/issues/1460)) Fix a potential bug with `ByteStream`'s implementation of `futures_core::stream::Stream` and add helpful error messages
    for users on 32-bit systems that try to stream HTTP bodies larger than 4.29Gb.
- üêõ ([smithy-rs#1427](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy-rs/issues/1427), [smithy-rs#1465](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy-rs/issues/1465), [smithy-rs#1459](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy-rs/issues/1459)) Fix RustWriter bugs for `rustTemplate` and `docs` utility methods
- üêõ ([aws-sdk-rust#554](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/issues/554)) Requests to Route53 that return `ResourceId`s often come with a prefix. When passing those IDs directly into another
    request, the request would fail unless they manually stripped the prefix. Now, when making a request with a prefixed ID,
    the prefix will be stripped automatically.


v0.43.0 (June 9th, 2022)
========================
**New this release:**
- üéâ ([smithy-rs#1381](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy-rs/issues/1381), @alonlud) Add ability to sign a request with all headers, or to change which headers are excluded from signing
- üéâ ([smithy-rs#1390](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy-rs/issues/1390)) Add method `ByteStream::into_async_read`. This makes it easy to convert `ByteStream`s into a struct implementing `tokio:io::AsyncRead`. Available on **crate feature** `rt-tokio` only.
- ([smithy-rs#1404](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy-rs/issues/1404), @petrosagg) Add ability to specify a different rust crate name than the one derived from the package name
- ([smithy-rs#1404](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy-rs/issues/1404), @petrosagg) Switch to [RustCrypto](https://github.com/RustCrypto)'s implementation of MD5.

v0.42.0 (May 13th, 2022)
========================
**Breaking Changes:**
- ‚ö†üéâ ([aws-sdk-rust#494](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/issues/494), [aws-sdk-rust#519](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/issues/519)) The `aws_smithy_http::byte_stream::bytestream_util::FsBuilder` has been updated to allow for easier creation of
    multi-part requests.

    - `FsBuilder::offset` is a new method allowing users to specify an offset to start reading a file from.
    - `FsBuilder::file_size` has been reworked into `FsBuilder::length` and is now used to specify the amount of data to read.

    With these two methods, it's now simple to create a `ByteStream` that will read a single "chunk" of a file. The example
    below demonstrates how you could divide a single `File` into consecutive chunks to create multiple `ByteStream`s.

    ```rust
    let example_file_path = Path::new("/example.txt");
    let example_file_size = tokio::fs::metadata(&example_file_path).await.unwrap().len();
    let chunks = 6;
    let chunk_size = file_size / chunks;
    let mut byte_streams = Vec::new();

    for i in 0..chunks {
        let length = if i == chunks - 1 {
            // If we're on the last chunk, the length to read might be less than a whole chunk.
            // We substract the size of all previous chunks from the total file size to get the
            // size of the final chunk.
            file_size - (i * chunk_size)
        } else {
            chunk_size
        };

        let byte_stream = ByteStream::read_from()
            .path(&file_path)
            .offset(i * chunk_size)
            .length(length)
            .build()
            .await?;

        byte_streams.push(byte_stream);
    }

    for chunk in byte_streams {
        // Make requests to a service
    }
    ```

**New this release:**

0.41.0 (April 28th, 2022)
=========================
**Breaking Changes:**
- ‚ö† ([smithy-rs#1318](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy-rs/issues/1318)) Bump [MSRV](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust#supported-rust-versions-msrv) from 1.56.1 to 1.58.1 per our "two versions behind" policy.

**New this release:**
- ([smithy-rs#1307](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy-rs/issues/1307)) Add new trait for HTTP body callbacks. This is the first step to enabling us to implement optional checksum verification of requests and responses.
- ([smithy-rs#1330](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy-rs/issues/1330)) Upgrade to Smithy 1.21.0


0.40.2 (April 14th, 2022)
=========================

**Breaking Changes:**
- ‚ö† ([aws-sdk-rust#490](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/issues/490)) Update all runtime crates to [edition 2021](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2021/10/21/Rust-1.56.0.html)

**New this release:**
- ([smithy-rs#1262](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy-rs/issues/1262), @liubin) Fix link to Developer Guide in crate's README.md
- ([smithy-rs#1301](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy-rs/issues/1301), @benesch) Update urlencoding crate to v2.1.0

0.39.0 (March 17, 2022)
=======================
**Breaking Changes:**
- ‚ö† ([aws-sdk-rust#406](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/issues/406)) `aws_types::config::Config` has been renamed to `aws_types:sdk_config::SdkConfig`. This is to better differentiate it
    from service-specific configs like `aws_s3_sdk::Config`. If you were creating shared configs with
    `aws_config::load_from_env()`, then you don't have to do anything. If you were directly referring to a shared config,
    update your `use` statements and `struct` names.

    _Before:_
    ```rust
    use aws_types::config::Config;

    fn main() {
        let config = Config::builder()
        // config builder methods...
        .build()
        .await;
    }
    ```

    _After:_
    ```rust
    use aws_types::SdkConfig;

    fn main() {
        let config = SdkConfig::builder()
        // config builder methods...
        .build()
        .await;
    }
    ```
- ‚ö† ([smithy-rs#724](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy-rs/issues/724)) Timeout configuration has been refactored a bit. If you were setting timeouts through environment variables or an AWS
    profile, then you shouldn't need to change anything. Take note, however, that we don't currently support HTTP connect,
    read, write, or TLS negotiation timeouts. If you try to set any of those timeouts in your profile or environment, we'll
    log a warning explaining that those timeouts don't currently do anything.

    If you were using timeouts programmatically,
    you'll need to update your code. In previous versions, timeout configuration was stored in a single `TimeoutConfig`
    struct. In this new version, timeouts have been broken up into several different config structs that are then collected
    in a `timeout::Config` struct. As an example, to get the API per-attempt timeout in previous versions you would access
    it with `<your TimeoutConfig>.api_call_attempt_timeout()` and in this new version you would access it with
    `<your timeout::Config>.api.call_attempt_timeout()`. We also made some unimplemented timeouts inaccessible in order to
    avoid giving users the impression that setting them had an effect. We plan to re-introduce them once they're made
    functional in a future update.

**New this release:**
- ([smithy-rs#1225](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy-rs/issues/1225)) `DynMiddleware` is now `clone`able
- ([smithy-rs#1257](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy-rs/issues/1257)) HTTP request property bag now contains list of desired HTTP versions to use when making requests. This list is not currently used but will be in an upcoming update.


0.38.0 (Februrary 24, 2022)
===========================
**Breaking Changes:**
- ‚ö† ([smithy-rs#1197](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy-rs/issues/1197)) `aws_smithy_types::retry::RetryKind` had its `NotRetryable` variant split into `UnretryableFailure` and `Unnecessary`. If you implement the `ClassifyResponse`, then successful responses need to return `Unnecessary`, and failures that shouldn't be retried need to return `UnretryableFailure`.
- ‚ö† ([smithy-rs#1209](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy-rs/issues/1209)) `aws_smithy_types::primitive::Encoder` is now a struct rather than an enum, but its usage remains the same.
- ‚ö† ([smithy-rs#1217](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy-rs/issues/1217)) `ClientBuilder` helpers `rustls()` and `native_tls()` now return `DynConnector` and use dynamic dispatch rather than returning their concrete connector type that would allow static dispatch. If static dispatch is desired, then manually construct a connector to give to the builder. For example, for rustls: `builder.connector(Adapter::builder().build(aws_smithy_client::conns::https()))` (where `Adapter` is in `aws_smithy_client::hyper_ext`).

**New this release:**
- üêõ ([smithy-rs#1197](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy-rs/issues/1197)) Fixed a bug that caused clients to eventually stop retrying. The cross-request retry allowance wasn't being reimbursed upon receiving a successful response, so once this allowance reached zero, no further retries would ever be attempted.


0.37.0 (February 18th, 2022)
============================
**Breaking Changes:**
- ‚ö† ([smithy-rs#1144](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy-rs/issues/1144)) Some APIs required that timeout configuration be specified with an `aws_smithy_client::timeout::Settings` struct while
    others required an `aws_smithy_types::timeout::TimeoutConfig` struct. Both were equivalent. Now `aws_smithy_types::timeout::TimeoutConfig`
    is used everywhere and `aws_smithy_client::timeout::Settings` has been removed. Here's how to migrate code your code that
    depended on `timeout::Settings`:

    The old way:
    ```rust
    let timeout = timeout::Settings::new()
        .with_connect_timeout(Duration::from_secs(1))
        .with_read_timeout(Duration::from_secs(2));
    ```

    The new way:
    ```rust
    // This example is passing values, so they're wrapped in `Option::Some`. You can disable a timeout by passing `None`.
    let timeout = TimeoutConfig::new()
        .with_connect_timeout(Some(Duration::from_secs(1)))
        .with_read_timeout(Some(Duration::from_secs(2)));
    ```
- ‚ö† ([smithy-rs#1085](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy-rs/issues/1085)) Moved the following re-exports into a `types` module for all services:
    - `<service>::AggregatedBytes` -> `<service>::types::AggregatedBytes`
    - `<service>::Blob` -> `<service>::types::Blob`
    - `<service>::ByteStream` -> `<service>::types::ByteStream`
    - `<service>::DateTime` -> `<service>::types::DateTime`
    - `<service>::SdkError` -> `<service>::types::SdkError`
- ‚ö† ([smithy-rs#1085](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy-rs/issues/1085)) `AggregatedBytes` and `ByteStream` are now only re-exported if the service has streaming operations,
    and `Blob`/`DateTime` are only re-exported if the service uses them.
- ‚ö† ([smithy-rs#1130](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy-rs/issues/1130)) MSRV increased from `1.54` to `1.56.1` per our 2-behind MSRV policy.

**New this release:**
- ([smithy-rs#1144](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy-rs/issues/1144)) `MakeConnectorFn`, `HttpConnector`, and `HttpSettings` have been moved from `aws_config::provider_config` to
    `aws_smithy_client::http_connector`. This is in preparation for a later update that will change how connectors are
    created and configured.
- ([smithy-rs#1123](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy-rs/issues/1123)) Refactor `Document` shape parser generation
- ([smithy-rs#1085](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy-rs/issues/1085)) The `Client` and `Config` re-exports now have their documentation inlined in the service docs


0.36.0 (January 26, 2022)
=========================
**New this release:**
- ([smithy-rs#1087](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy-rs/issues/1087)) Improve docs on `Endpoint::{mutable, immutable}`
- ([smithy-rs#1118](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy-rs/issues/1118)) SDK examples now come from [`awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples`](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples) rather than from `smithy-rs`
- ([smithy-rs#1114](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy-rs/issues/1114), @mchoicpe-amazon) Provide SigningService creation via owned String

v0.34.1 (January 10, 2022)
==========================
**New this release:**
- üêõ (smithy-rs#1054, aws-sdk-rust#391) Fix critical paginator bug where an empty outputToken lead to a never ending stream.



0.34.0 (January 6th, 2022)
==========================
**Breaking Changes:**
- ‚ö† (smithy-rs#990) Codegen will no longer produce builders and clients with methods that take `impl Into<T>` except for strings and boxed types.
- ‚ö† (smithy-rs#1003) The signature of `aws_smithy_protocol_test::validate_headers` was made more flexible but may require adjusting invocations slightly.

**New this release:**
- üéâ (aws-sdk-rust#47, smithy-rs#1006) Add support for paginators!

v0.33.0 (December 15th, 2021)
=============================
**Breaking Changes:**
- ‚ö† (smithy-rs#930) Runtime crates no longer have default features. You must now specify the features that you want when you add a dependency to your `Cargo.toml`.

    **Upgrade guide**

    | before                          | after |
    |---------------------------------|-------|
    | `aws-smithy-async = "VERSION"`  | `aws-smithy-async = { version = "VERSION", features = ["rt-tokio"] }` |
    | `aws-smithy-client = "VERSION"` | `aws-smithy-client = { version = "VERSION", features = ["client-hyper", "rustls", "rt-tokio"] }` |
    | `aws-smithy-http = "VERSION"`   | `aws-smithy-http = { version = "VERSION", features = ["rt-tokio"] }` |
- ‚ö† (smithy-rs#940) `aws_smithy_client::Client::https()` has been renamed to `dyn_https()`.
    This is to clearly distinguish it from `rustls` and `native_tls` which do not use a boxed connector.

**New this week**
- Improve docs on `aws-smithy-client` (smithy-rs#855)
- Fix http-body dependency version (smithy-rs#883, aws-sdk-rust#305)
- `SdkError` now includes a variant `TimeoutError` for when a request times out (smithy-rs#885)
- Timeouts for requests are now configurable. You can set separate timeouts for each individual request attempt and all attempts made for a request. (smithy-rs#831)

**Breaking Changes**
- (aws-smithy-client): Extraneous `pub use SdkSuccess` removed from `aws_smithy_client::hyper_ext`. (smithy-rs#855)


v0.29.0-alpha (November 11th, 2021)
===================================

**Breaking Changes**

Several breaking changes around `aws_smithy_types::Instant` were introduced by smithy-rs#849:
- `aws_smithy_types::Instant` from was renamed to `DateTime` to avoid confusion with the standard library's monotonically non-decreasing `Instant` type.
- `DateParseError` in `aws_smithy_types` has been renamed to `DateTimeParseError` to match the type that's being parsed.
- The `chrono-conversions` feature and associated functions have been moved to the `aws-smithy-types-convert` crate.
  - Calls to `Instant::from_chrono` should be changed to:
    ```rust
    use aws_smithy_types::DateTime;
    use aws_smithy_types_convert::date_time::DateTimeExt;

    // For chrono::DateTime<Utc>
    let date_time = DateTime::from_chrono_utc(chrono_date_time);
    // For chrono::DateTime<FixedOffset>
    let date_time = DateTime::from_chrono_offset(chrono_date_time);
    ```
  - Calls to `instant.to_chrono()` should be changed to:
    ```rust
    use aws_smithy_types_convert::date_time::DateTimeExt;

    date_time.to_chrono_utc();
    ```
- `Instant::from_system_time` and `Instant::to_system_time` have been changed to `From` trait implementations.
  - Calls to `from_system_time` should be changed to:
    ```rust
    DateTime::from(system_time);
    // or
    let date_time: DateTime = system_time.into();
    ```
  - Calls to `to_system_time` should be changed to:
    ```rust
    SystemTime::from(date_time);
    // or
    let system_time: SystemTime = date_time.into();
    ```
- Several functions in `Instant`/`DateTime` were renamed:
  - `Instant::from_f64` -> `DateTime::from_secs_f64`
  - `Instant::from_fractional_seconds` -> `DateTime::from_fractional_secs`
  - `Instant::from_epoch_seconds` -> `DateTime::from_secs`
  - `Instant::from_epoch_millis` -> `DateTime::from_millis`
  - `Instant::epoch_fractional_seconds` -> `DateTime::as_secs_f64`
  - `Instant::has_nanos` -> `DateTime::has_subsec_nanos`
  - `Instant::epoch_seconds` -> `DateTime::secs`
  - `Instant::epoch_subsecond_nanos` -> `DateTime::subsec_nanos`
  - `Instant::to_epoch_millis` -> `DateTime::to_millis`
- The `DateTime::fmt` method is now fallible and fails when a `DateTime`'s value is outside what can be represented by the desired date format.
- In `aws-sigv4`, the `SigningParams` builder's `date_time` setter was renamed to `time` and changed to take a `std::time::SystemTime` instead of a chrono's `DateTime<Utc>`.

**New this week**

- :warning: MSRV increased from 1.53.0 to 1.54.0 per our 3-behind MSRV policy.
- Conversions from `aws_smithy_types::DateTime` to `OffsetDateTime` from the `time` crate are now available from the `aws-smithy-types-convert` crate. (smithy-rs#849)
- Fixed links to Usage Examples (smithy-rs#862, @floric)

v0.28.0-alpha (November 11th, 2021)
===================================

No changes since last release except for version bumping since older versions
of the AWS SDK were failing to compile with the `0.27.0-alpha.2` version chosen
for the previous release.

v0.27.0-alpha.2 (November 9th, 2021)
=======================
**Breaking Changes**

- Members named `builder` on model structs were renamed to `builder_value` so that their accessors don't conflict with the existing `builder()` methods (smithy-rs#842)

**New this week**

- Fix epoch seconds date-time parsing bug in `aws-smithy-types` (smithy-rs#834)
- Omit trailing zeros from fraction when formatting HTTP dates in `aws-smithy-types` (smithy-rs#834)

v0.27.0-alpha.1 (November 3rd, 2021)
====================================
**Breaking Changes**
- `<operation>.make_operation(&config)` is now an `async` function for all operations. Code should be updated to call `.await`. This will only impact users using the low-level API. (smithy-rs#797)

**New this week**
- SDK code generation now includes a version in addition to path parameters when the `version` parameter is included in smithy-build.json
- `moduleDescription` in `smithy-build.json` settings is now optional
- Upgrade to Smithy 1.12
- `hyper::Error(IncompleteMessage)` will now be retried (smithy-rs#815)
- Unions will optionally generate an `Unknown` variant to support parsing variants that don't exist on the client. These variants will fail to serialize if they are ever included in requests.
- Fix generated docs on unions. (smithy-rs#826)

v0.27 (October 20th, 2021)
==========================

**Breaking Changes**

- :warning: All Smithy runtime crates have been renamed to have an `aws-` prefix. This may require code changes:
  - _Cargo.toml_ changes:
    - `smithy-async` -> `aws-smithy-async`
    - `smithy-client` -> `aws-smithy-client`
    - `smithy-eventstream` -> `aws-smithy-eventstream`

    - `smithy-types` -> `aws-smithy-types`
    - `smithy-xml` -> `aws-smithy-xml`
  - Rust `use` statement changes:
    - `smithy_async` -> `aws_smithy_async`
    - `smithy_client` -> `aws_smithy_client`
    - `smithy_eventstream` -> `aws_smithy_eventstream`
    - `smithy_http` -> `aws_smithy_http`
    - `smithy_http_tower` -> `aws_smithy_http_tower`
    - `smithy_json` -> `aws_smithy_json`
    - `smithy_protocol_test` -> `aws_smithy_protocol_test`
    - `smithy_query` -> `aws_smithy_query`
    - `smithy_types` -> `aws_smithy_types`
    - `smithy_xml` -> `aws_smithy_xml`

**New this week**

- Filled in missing docs for services in the rustdoc documentation (smithy-rs#779)

v0.26 (October 15th, 2021)
=======================

**Breaking Changes**

- :warning: The `rust-codegen` plugin now requires a `moduleDescription` in the *smithy-build.json* file. This
  property goes into the generated *Cargo.toml* file as the package description. (smithy-rs#766)

**New this week**

- Add `RustSettings` to `CodegenContext` (smithy-rs#616, smithy-rs#752)
- Prepare crate manifests for publishing to crates.io (smithy-rs#755)

v0.25.1 (October 11th, 2021)
=========================
**New this week**
- :bug: Re-add missing deserialization operations that were missing because of a typo in `HttpBoundProtocolGenerator.kt`

v0.25 (October 7th, 2021)
=========================
**Breaking changes**
- :warning: MSRV increased from 1.52.1 to 1.53.0 per our 3-behind MSRV policy.
- :warning: `smithy_client::retry::Config` field `max_retries` is renamed to `max_attempts`
  - This also brings a change to the semantics of the field. In the old version, setting `max_retries` to 3 would mean
    that up to 4 requests could occur (1 initial request and 3 retries). In the new version, setting `max_attempts` to 3
    would mean that up to 3 requests could occur (1 initial request and 2 retries).
- :warning: `smithy_client::retry::Config::with_max_retries` method is renamed to `with_max_attempts`
- :warning: Several classes in the codegen module were renamed and/or refactored (smithy-rs#735):
  - `ProtocolConfig` became `CodegenContext` and moved to `software.amazon.smithy.rust.codegen.smithy`
  - `HttpProtocolGenerator` became `ProtocolGenerator` and was refactored
    to rely on composition instead of inheritance
  - `HttpProtocolTestGenerator` became `ProtocolTestGenerator`
  - `Protocol` moved into `software.amazon.smithy.rust.codegen.smithy.protocols`
- `SmithyConnector` and `DynConnector` now return `ConnectorError` instead of `Box<dyn Error>`. If you have written a custom connector, it will need to be updated to return the new error type. (#744)
- The `DispatchError` variant of `SdkError` now contains `ConnectorError` instead of `Box<dyn Error>` (#744).

**New this week**

- :bug: Fix an issue where `smithy-xml` may have generated invalid XML (smithy-rs#719)
- Add `RetryConfig` struct for configuring retry behavior (smithy-rs#725)
- :bug: Fix error when receiving empty event stream messages (smithy-rs#736)
- :bug: Fix bug in event stream receiver that could cause the last events in the response stream to be lost (smithy-rs#736)
- Add connect & HTTP read timeouts to IMDS, defaulting to 1 second
- IO and timeout errors from Hyper can now be retried (#744)

v0.23 (September 14th, 2021)
=======================

**New This Week**
- :bug: Fixes issue where `Content-Length` header could be duplicated leading to signing failure (aws-sdk-rust#220, smithy-rs#697)
- :bug: Fixes naming collision during generation of model shapes that collide with `<operationname>Input` and `<operationname>Output` (#699)

v0.22 (September 2nd, 2021)
===========================

This release adds support for three commonly requested features:
- More powerful credential chain
- Support for constructing multiple clients from the same configuration
- Support for Transcribe streaming and S3 Select

In addition, this overhauls client configuration which lead to a number of breaking changes. Detailed changes are inline.

Current Credential Provider Support:
- [x] Environment variables
- [x] Web Identity Token Credentials
- [ ] Profile file support (partial)
  - [ ] Credentials
    - [ ] SSO
    - [ ] ECS Credential source
    - [ ] IMDS credential source
    - [x] Assume role from source profile
    - [x] Static credentials source profile
    - [x] WebTokenIdentity provider
  - [x] Region
- [ ] IMDS
- [ ] ECS

Upgrade Guide
-------------

### If you use `<sdk>::Client::from_env`

`from_env` loaded region & credentials from environment variables _only_. Default sources have been removed from the generated
SDK clients and moved to the `aws-config` package. Note that the `aws-config` package default chain adds support for
profile file and web identity token profiles.

1. Add a dependency on `aws-config`:
     ```toml
     [dependencies]
     aws-config = { git = "https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust", tag = "v0.0.17-alpha" }
     ```
2. Update your client creation code:
   ```rust
   // `shared_config` can be used to construct multiple different service clients!
   let shared_config = aws_config::load_from_env().await;
   // before: <service>::Client::from_env();
   let client = <service>::Client::new(&shared_config)
   ```

### If you used `<client>::Config::builder()`

`Config::build()` has been modified to _not_ fallback to a default provider. Instead, use `aws-config` to load and modify
the default chain. Note that when you switch to `aws-config`, support for profile files and web identity tokens will be added.

1. Add a dependency on `aws-config`:
     ```toml
     [dependencies]
     aws-config = { git = "https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust", tag = "v0.0.17-alpha" }
     ```

2. Update your client creation code:

   ```rust
   fn before() {
     let region = aws_types::region::ChainProvider::first_try(<1 provider>).or_default_provider();
     let config = <service>::Config::builder().region(region).build();
     let client = <service>::Client::from_conf(&config);
   }

   async fn after() {
     use aws_config::meta::region::RegionProviderChain;
     let region_provider = RegionProviderChain::first_try(<1 provider>).or_default_provider();
     // `shared_config` can be used to construct multiple different service clients!
     let shared_config = aws_config::from_env().region(region_provider).load().await;
     let client = <service>::Client::new(&shared_config)
   }
   ```

### If you used `aws-auth-providers`
All credential providers that were in `aws-auth-providers` have been moved to `aws-config`. Unless you have a specific use case
for a specific credential provider, you should use the default provider chain:

```rust
 let shared_config = aws_config::load_from_env().await;
 let client = <service>::Client::new(&shared_config);
```

### If you maintain your own credential provider

`AsyncProvideCredentials` has been renamed to `ProvideCredentials`. The trait has been moved from `aws-auth` to `aws-types`.
The original `ProvideCredentials` trait has been removed. The return type has been changed to by a custom future.

For synchronous use cases:
```rust
use aws_types::credentials::{ProvideCredentials, future};

#[derive(Debug)]
struct CustomCreds;
impl ProvideCredentials for CustomCreds {
  fn provide_credentials<'a>(&'a self) -> future::ProvideCredentials<'a>
    where
            Self: 'a,
  {
    // if your credentials are synchronous, use `::ready`
    // if your credentials are loaded asynchronously, use `::new`
    future::ProvideCredentials::ready(todo!()) // your credentials go here
  }
}
```

For asynchronous use cases:
```rust
use aws_types::credentials::{ProvideCredentials, future, Result};

#[derive(Debug)]
struct CustomAsyncCreds;
impl CustomAsyncCreds {
  async fn load_credentials(&self) -> Result {
    Ok(Credentials::from_keys("my creds...", "secret", None))
  }
}

impl ProvideCredentials for CustomCreds {
  fn provide_credentials<'a>(&'a self) -> future::ProvideCredentials<'a>
    where
            Self: 'a,
  {
    future::ProvideCredentials::new(self.load_credentials())
  }
}
```

Changes
-------

**Breaking Changes**

- Credential providers from `aws-auth-providers` have been moved to `aws-config` (#678)
- `AsyncProvideCredentials` has been renamed to `ProvideCredentials`. The original non-async provide credentials has been
  removed. See the migration guide above.
- `<sevicename>::from_env()` has been removed (#675). A drop-in replacement is available:
  1. Add a dependency on `aws-config`:
     ```toml
     [dependencies]
     aws-config = { git = "https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust", tag = "v0.0.17-alpha" }
     ```
  2. Update your client creation code:
     ```rust
     let client = <service>>::Client::new(&aws_config::load_from_env().await)
     ```

- `ProvideRegion` has been moved to `aws_config::meta::region::ProvideRegion`. (#675)
- `aws_types::region::ChainProvider` has been moved to `aws_config::meta::region::RegionProviderChain` (#675).
- `ProvideRegion` is now asynchronous. Code that called `provider.region()` must be changed to `provider.region().await`.
- `<awsservice>::Config::builder()` will **not** load a default region. To preserve previous behavior:
  1. Add a dependency on `aws-config`:
     ```toml
     [dependencies]
     aws-config = { git = "https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust", tag = "v0.0.17-alpha" }
     ```
  2. ```rust
     let shared_config = aws_config::load_from_env().await;
     let config = <service>::config::Builder::from(&shared_config).<other builder modifications>.build();
     ```
- `Request` and `Response` in `smithy_http::operation` now use `SharedPropertyBag` instead of `Arc<Mutex<PropertyBag>>`. Use the `acquire` and `acquire_mut` methods to get a reference to the underlying `PropertyBag` to access properties. (#667)

**New this week**

- :tada: Add profile file provider for region (#594, #682)
- :tada: Add support for shared configuration between multiple services (#673)
- :tada: Add support for Transcribe `StartStreamTranscription` and S3 `SelectObjectContent` operations (#667)

**Internal Changes**

- Add Event Stream support for restJson1 and restXml (#653, #667)
- Add NowOrLater future to smithy-async (#672)


v0.21 (August 19th, 2021)
=========================

**New This Week**

- :tada: Add Chime Identity, Chime Messaging, and Snow Device Management support (#657)
- :tada: Add profile file credential provider implementation. This implementation currently does not support credential sources for assume role providers other than environment variables. (#640)
- :tada: Add support for WebIdentityToken providers via profile & environment variables. (#654)
- :bug: Fix name collision that occurred when a model had both a union and a structure named `Result` (#643)
- :bug: Fix STS Assume Role with WebIdentity & Assume role with SAML to support clients with no credentials provided (#652)
- Update AWS SDK models (#657)
- Add initial implementation of a default provider chain. (#650)

**Internal Changes**

- Update sigv4 tests to work around behavior change in httparse 1.5. (#656)
- Remove Bintray/JCenter source from gradle build. (#651)
- Add experimental `dvr` module to smithy-client. This will enable easier testing of HTTP traffic. (#640)
- Update smithy-client to simplify creating HTTP/HTTPS connectors (#650)
- Add Event Stream support to aws-sigv4 (#648)
- Add support for the smithy auth trait. This enables authorizations that explicitly disable authorization to work when no credentials have been provided. (#652)

v0.20 (August 10th, 2021)
=========================

**Breaking changes**

- (#635) The `config()`, `config_mut()`, `request()`, and `request_mut()` methods on `operation::Request` have been
  renamed to `properties()`, `properties_mut()`, `http()`, and `http_mut()` respectively.
- (#635) The `Response` type on Tower middleware has been changed from `http::Response<SdkBody>`
  to `operation::Response`. The HTTP response is still available from the `operation::Response` using its `http()`
  and `http_mut()` methods.
- (#635) The `ParseHttpResponse` trait's `parse_unloaded()` method now takes an `operation::Response` rather than
  an `http::Response<SdkBody>`.
- (#626) `ParseHttpResponse` no longer has a generic argument for the body type, but instead, always uses `SdkBody`.
  This may cause compilation failures for you if you are using Smithy generated types to parse JSON or XML without using
  a client to request data from a service. The fix should be as simple as removing `<SdkBody>` in the example below:

  Before:
  ```rust
  let output = <Query as ParseHttpResponse<SdkBody>>::parse_loaded(&parser, &response).unwrap();
  ```

  After:
  ```rust
  let output = <Query as ParseHttpResponse>::parse_loaded(&parser, &response).unwrap();
  ```

**New This Week**

- Add AssumeRoleProvider parser implementation. (#632)
- The closure passed to `provide_credentials_fn` can now borrow values (#637)
- Add `Sender`/`Receiver` implementations for Event Stream (#639)
- Bring in the latest AWS models (#630)

v0.19 (August 3rd, 2021)
========================

IoT Data Plane is now available! If you discover it isn't functioning as expected, please let us know!

This week also sees the addition of a robust async caching credentials provider. Take a look at the
[STS example](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy-rs/blob/7fa4af4a9367aeca6d55e26fc4d4ba93093b90c4/aws/sdk/examples/sts/src/bin/credentials-provider.rs)
to see how to use it.

**New This Week**

- :tada: Add LazyCachingCredentialsProvider to aws-auth for use with expiring credentials, such as STS AssumeRole.
  Update STS example to use this new provider (#578, #595)
- :bug: Correctly encode HTTP Checksums using base64 instead of hex. Fixes aws-sdk-rust#164. (#615)
- Update SDK gradle build logic to use gradle properties (#620)
- Overhaul serialization/deserialization of numeric/boolean types. This resolves issues around serialization of
  NaN/Infinity and should also reduce the number of allocations required during serialization. (#618)

========================

- Remove timestreamwrite and timestreamquery from the generated services (#613)

v0.18 (July 27th 2021)
======================

**Breaking changes**

- `test-util` has been made an optional dependency and has moved from aws-hyper to smithy-http. If you were relying
  on `aws_hyper::TestConnection`, add `smithy-client` as a dependency and enable the optional `test-util` feature. This
  prunes some unnecessary dependencies on `roxmltree` and `serde_json`
  for most users. (#608)

**New This Week**

- :tada: Release all but three remaining AWS services! Glacier, IoT Data Plane and Transcribe streaming will be
  available in a future release. If you discover that a service isn't functioning as expected please let us know! (#607)
